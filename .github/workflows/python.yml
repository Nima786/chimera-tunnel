# Name of the workflow
name: Python Linter and Test

# When to run the workflow
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  lint-and-test:
    # Run on a standard Ubuntu machine
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    # Step 1: Check out your code
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4

    # Step 2: Set up the Python environment
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v5
      with:
        python-version: '3.9' # Use a modern version of Python

    # Step 3: Install dependencies
    # We will use flake8, a popular tool for checking for bugs and style errors.
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install flake8

    # Step 4: Lint with flake8
    # This command checks for common Python errors like syntax errors,
    # undefined variables, and unused imports. If it finds any, the workflow will fail.
    - name: Lint with flake8
      run: |
        # stop the build if there are Python syntax errors or undefined names
        flake8 . --count --select=E9,F63,F7,F82 --show-source --statistics
        # exit-zero treats all errors as warnings. The GitHub editor is 127 chars wide
        flake8 . --count --exit-zero --max-complexity=10 --max-line-length=127 --statistics

    # Step 5 (for the future): Run tests
    # This step is a placeholder. If we add a real test suite later (e.g., with pytest),
    # this step will automatically run it.
    - name: Test with pytest
      run: |
        # pip install pytest
        # pytest
        echo "No pytest tests configured yet. Skipping."
